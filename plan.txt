Apologies for jumping ahead. I'd be happy to ask you some questions to better understand your requirements. Please provide your responses, and I'll tailor the code accordingly:

1. Which programming language would you like to use for this tool?
2. Are you comfortable with using a personal access token (PAT) to authenticate with the GitHub API?
3. Do you want to list branches from all of your repositories or just specific repositories?
4. If you want to list branches from specific repositories, please provide the names of those repositories.
5. Should the tool only list branches created by you, or do you want to include branches created by others as well?
6. How would you like the tool to display the branch information? For example, do you want it to print to the console or generate a file?
7. Are there any additional features or specific requirements you have in mind for this tool?

Once I have your responses, I'll be able to provide a more customized solution for you.

==============
==============

1. Golang
2. Yes, but let's keep those in environment variables and avoid hardcoding them
3. All branches, from a user or organization
4. Instead of this, let's introduce a user-input, regex-based filter for repository names
5. Just branches created by me
6. Print to console, json format
7a. If a branch has a pull request associated with it, include that information as well.
7b. Similar to 4, have a regex-based filter for branch names.
7c. Don't use http requests directly, instead use the GitHub golang client library.
